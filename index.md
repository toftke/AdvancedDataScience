This is a basic tutorial on how to use the Vlookup tool in Microsoft Excel with examples included for some useful situations

## What is Vlookup?
VLookup can be used when you have a lot of data in an excel sheet, and works best when the thing you want to use to look up is on the left side of what you want to find. 
The formula for VLookup has 4 different parts, the lookup value, the table array, the column index number, and the Approximate match.
We'll examine each part of the formula by itself before putting it all together

## The Lookup Value

The Lookup Value is a sort of reference value that you will use in order to search through your data

## Table Array

The table array is the range of data that you want your data to look through

## Column Index Number

The Column index Number is the column you want to search through and find the match for your lookup value. Columns are indexed at 1, starting from the first column of your table array

## Approximate Match

optionally, you can decide if you want an approximate value or if you want an exact match. If you want an approximate, either use TRUE or leave blank, if you want an exact match, use FALSE.
