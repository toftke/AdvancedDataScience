This is a basic tutorial on how to use the Vlookup tool in Microsoft Excel with examples included for some useful situations

## What is Vlookup?
VLookup is an excel tool that finds a match for a selected value within a different column of your table.
The formula for VLookup has 4 different parts, the lookup value, the table array, the column index number, and the Approximate match.
We'll examine each part of the formula by itself before putting it all together.

## Why use VLookup
VLookup is useful as a tool when your dataset is large and you're looking for a match to a specific value 

## The Lookup Value

## Approximate Match

Optionally, you can decide if you want an approximate value or if you want an exact match. If you want an approximate, either use TRUE or leave blank, if you want an exact match, use FALSE.
